# Portfolio Projects

In this section, I’ve compiled a selection of my data analysis projects that reflect my skills and interests. I’ve used various tools and techniques to analyze complex data and present clear, actionable insights. Below, you can explore how I’ve applied my expertise to different topics and deliver meaningful results.

**1. Productivity and Compensation Trends (1948-2021)**


Description: I examined the historical trends in productivity and compensation for the period from 1948 to 2021. By using SQL queries to explore and manipulate data, thus uncovering insights about changes in productivity and compensation over time, identify patterns, and compare different economic periods.


Tools: Excel, SQL

Code: [Productivity and Compensation Trends](https://github.com/Maliacarolinee/SQL/blob/main/Productivity%20and%20Compensation%20Trends%20(1948-2021).sql)


Key Insights: I identified significant trends in productivity and compensation over the decades and proposed strategies to better align wage growth with productivity increases.

**Productivity Trends:** Over the years, net productivity per hour worked has shown a general upward trend, with noticeable peaks and troughs. 

**Compensation Trends:** Average compensation has also increased over time, but not uniformly. 


**Disparities Between Productivity and Compensation:** 

**High Productivity, Low Compensation:** Several years have been identified where productivity was notably high while compensation remained relatively low. 

**Productivity Categories:** Years have been categorized into high, average, and low productivity based on their relative position to the overall average productivity. This categorization helps in understanding periods of exceptional performance versus those of lower productivity. 



# Excel

**1. Women's Happiness Score**

Description: I analyzed the 2021 rankings of women's happiness across various countries, focusing on regional differences. By leveraging Excel for data organization and analysis, I was able to identify patterns in happiness scores and compare happiness levels across regions.


Tools: Excel, Pivot Tables

Code: [Women's Happiness Score](https://github.com/Maliacarolinee/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/2021%20Womens%20Happiness%20Rankings%20by%20Country%20Dataset.xlsx)

Key Insights: Through this analysis, I uncovered significant variations in women's happiness across different countries and regions, and highlighted areas where policy improvements could enhance well-being.

**Happiness Rankings:** Countries were ranked based on the happiness scores of women, with regions like Scandinavia showing consistently high levels of happiness. 

**Regional Disparities:** Certain regions displayed wide disparities in happiness levels, suggesting that cultural, economic, and social factors play a crucial role in determining well-being.


**Policy Recommendations:** Based on the findings, I proposed strategies for governments to improve women's happiness by addressing specific areas like income inequality, healthcare access, and social support.

**2. Health Sleep Insights**

Description: I analyzed a dataset containing various health and lifestyle factors, such as age, gender, sleep quality, daily steps, physical activity level, and dietary habits, to uncover relationships between sleep patterns and overall health as well as the correlation. Using Excel to clean and organize the data, I employed pivot tables and basic statistics to generate insights into how these variables affect sleep quality and physical well-being.

Tools: Excel, Pivot Tables

Code: [Health Sleep Insights](https://github.com/Maliacarolinee/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Health%20Sleep%20Insights.xlsx)

**Key Insights:** My analysis revealed trends in sleep quality and its correlation with physical activity, dietary habits, and demographic factors such as age and gender.

**Physical Activity Categories:** Participants were categorized based on their physical activity levels, helping to better understand how varying levels of activity influence sleep quality and overall health outcomes.
