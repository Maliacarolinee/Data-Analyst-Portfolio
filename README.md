# SQL

Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Malia, I have an analytical background in Business with strong proficiency in SQL, Excel, and Tableau. I’ve developed a solid foundation in the life sciences, coupled with a passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights. I’m eager to apply my technical and analytical skills in the field of data science. 

In this portfolio, I have included data projects that showcase my technical skills as well as analytical capability. You will find documents, workbooks, presentation slides, and dashboards created with SQL, Tableau, Excel, and PowerPoint. These projects demonstrate my ability to organize, analyze, and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for anyone to understand and make informed decisions.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.


In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether collaborating on a team or working independently, I’m driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and the fulfillment of solving complex problems through data.
